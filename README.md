# Enhance Low Resolution Image using GANs

The project involves implementation of ESRGAN using PyTorch to enhance low resolution images having a lot of loss in details to images having great spatial resolution. If time permits , we shall build a basic web app to deploy the project . It will be extremely fun to learn about GANs and you shall gain a lot of insight on deep learning in general. One can check out https://youtu.be/WCAF3PNEc_c . Our project shall be on the same lines. You may also go through the Andrew NG course on CNN https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Gl29AoE31iwdVwSG-KnDzF. The research paper that we will largely be following https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00219 .

# Prerequisites
Intermediate Python Skills and a lot of Enthusiasm to learn about Deep Learning and Neural Networks.

# Resources
## Week 0
### Aim
During Week 0, we will review Python programming and object-oriented programming concepts. This knowledge will prove valuable when developing models.

## Week 1
### Aim
Get Acquainted with neural networks and the math behind it. You need not understand every nitty-griity of it , but this shall be your building blocks of deep learning to develop the intuition.
